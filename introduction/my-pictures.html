	<h1>Interesting Pictures</h1>
	<p>These pictures are from my wallpaper folder. I hope you like them as much as I do.</p>
	<h2>Avengers Endgame is coming soon.</h2>
	<p>This is a cool artwork picture of the Avengers that shows a good amount of heroes I personally like, especially Iron Man and Spider-Man.</p>
	<p>Because of licensing, or lack of, here's a picture of the country I want to visit the most, Japan.</p>
	<img src="pictures/japan.jpg" alt="japan"/>
	<h2>Digimon > Pokemon</h2>
	<p>Digimon was one of my favorite shows growing up. If you're unfamiliar with the show, this picture is actually an "all-grown up" version of the original.</p>
	<p>Because of licensing, or lack of, here's a picture of the closest thing we have to digimon.</p>
	<img src="pictures/bear.jpg" alt="bear"/>
	<h2>Blizzard is my dream company</h2>
	<p>My two favorite games all time are Overwatch and WoW, which were both made by Blizzard. To work there for a career would allow me to develop/maintain games so others could enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
	<p>Because of licensing, or lack of, here's a picture an actual blizzard</p>
