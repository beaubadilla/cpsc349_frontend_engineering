		<h1>Why This Course?</h1>
			<h2>Graduation</h2>
				<p class=oddparagraphs>Probably the biggest reason why I chose this course was because I needed to take two comsci electives to stay on pace to graduate Fall 2019. However, out of all eligible electives, I did have this course ranked higher than others because I was fortunate enough to gain some experience in Web Dev from the Software Engineering course (CPSC 362) and want to know more.</p>
			<h2>Career</h2>
				<p class=evenparagraphs>Web development is definitely a path I can see myself pursuing for my career. But, one thing that deters me from pursuing Web Dev is the need for an artistic eye. I realize that there are web designers/UX designers for that, but I still feel it is a necessary skill.</p>
			<h2>Professor</h2>
				<p class=oddparagraphs>Had the professor last semester. Great professor (teaching style, patience to help, difficulty of assignments), which can be hard to find these days.</p>

	<h1>Experience with Web Dev</h1>
	<p class=evenparagraphs>I tried to learn HTML/CSS about 2 years ago to make my own personal website, but the block style was too overwhelming for me at the time. I got too frustrated with trying to make it look perfect on every platform/device.</p>
	<p class=oddparagraphs>A year later, my group in CPSC 362 decided to make a Web App for our semester project which introduced me to JavaScript, front-end, and back-end concepts.</p>
	<h1>What am I hoping to learn?</h1>
	<p class=evenparagraphs>I want to learn how to build a web app from the ground-up by myself. And not only how to build it, but really understand what's going on on the front-end side.</p>
